ONE. submission 1 [accepted] [O(js)]
```python
def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
    """
    :type J: str
    :type S: str
    :rtype: int
    """
    sum = 0
    for s in S:
        if s in J:
            sum += 1
    return sum
```

TWO. one-line python [O(j*s)]
```python
def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
    return sum(s in J for s in S)
```

TWO. one-line python [O(j*s)]
```python
def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
    return sum(s in J for s in S)
```

THREE. map [O(m+n)]
```python
def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
    return sum(map(J.count, S))
```
```python
def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
    return sum(map(S.count, J))
```

FOUR. regular expression 
- [^xyz], matches everything that is not xyz. 
- This code replace everything in S that is not a jewel with an empty string. What is left is a string with only characters in J, so we count the number of remaining characters.
```java
public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
    return S.replaceAll("[^" + J + "]", "").length();
}
```
