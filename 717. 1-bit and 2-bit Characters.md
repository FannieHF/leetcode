title: 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
date:2018-03-03 01:41:11

# Description
We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).
Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```
**Note:**
- `1 <= len(bits) <= 1000`.
- `bits[i]` is always `0` or `1`.

##1. 
```python
def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits):
    string = "".join(map(str,bits))
    string = string[::-1]
    import re
    if '1' in string:
        split_place = re.search(r"1+",string).group(0)
        if len(split_place)%2 == 0:
            return True
        else:
            last = string.split(split_place)[0][:-1]
        return '0' in last
    else:
        return True
```

##2. Clever Me
```python 
def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits):
    import re
    string = "".join(map(str,bits))
    if '1' in string:
        last = re.search(r"1*0+$",string).group(0)
        if last.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return '0' in last[last.count('1')+1:]
    return True
```

## 3. Simpler
```python
def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits):
    ones = 0
    i = len(bits) - 2
    while i >= 0 and bits[i] != 0:
        ones += 1
        i -= 1
    return False if ones % 2 > 0 else True
        
```
