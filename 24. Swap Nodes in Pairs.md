title: 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
date:2018-03-04 19:01:09

# Description
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
**For example,**
Given `1->2->3->4`, you should return the list as `2->1->4->3`.
Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

# Answer
##1. iterative
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        keepHead = ListNode("")
        keepHead.next = head
        pre = keepHead
        while pre.next and pre.next.next:
            head = pre.next
            pre.next, head.next.next, head.next = head.next,head,head.next.next
            pre = head
        return keepHead.next
```

##2. recursion
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        newHead = head.next
        head.next = newHead.next
        newHead.next = head
        head.next = self.swapPairs(head.next)
        
        return newHead
```

## 3. using "self" instead of creating a new ListNode
Here, pre is the previous node. Since the head doesnâ€™t have a previous node, I just use self instead. Again, a is the current node and b is the next node.

To go from pre -> a -> b -> b.next to pre -> b -> a -> b.next, we need to change those three references. Instead of thinking about in what order I change them, I just change all three at once.
```python
def swapPairs(self, head):
    pre, pre.next = self, head
    while pre.next and pre.next.next:
        a = pre.next
        b = a.next
        pre.next, b.next, a.next = b, a, b.next
        pre = a
    return self.next
```
