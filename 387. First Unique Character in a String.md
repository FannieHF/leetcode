date:2018-03-05 18:33:00

# Description
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
**Examples:**
```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```
**Note: **You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

# Answer

## 1. stupid
```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        appear = set()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if not (s[i] in appear or s[i] in s[i+1:]):
                return i
            appear.add(s[i])
        return -1
```

##2. dictionary
```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        letter_dict = {}
        for letter in s:
            letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict.get(letter,0) + 1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if letter_dict[s[i]] == 1:
                return i
        return -1
            
```

##3. assume s only has 26 letters
```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        letters='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        # not to use "return min([s.index(l) for l in s if s.count(l) == 1] or [-1])"
        # otherwise if s is really long, it will cause "	Time Limit Exceeded"
        return min([s.index(l) for l in letters if s.count(l) == 1] or [-1])
```
