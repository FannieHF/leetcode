title: 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes
date:2018-03-07 23:38:43

# Description
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

**Example :**
```Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```
**Note:**
1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
2. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

# Answer
```python3
class Solution:
    def minDiffInBST(self, root):
        self.seq = []
        
        def inorder(root):
            if not root:
                return
            inorder(root.left)
            self.seq.append(root.val)
            inorder(root.right)
        
        inorder(root)
        return min(list(map(lambda x: abs(x[0]-x[1]),zip(self.seq,self.seq[1:]))))
```

## global to store previous number in the tree
```python3
class Solution:
    def minDiffInBST(self, root):
        self.diff = float('inf')
        self.pre =  float('-inf')
        
        def inorder(root):
            if not root:
                return
            inorder(root.left)
            self.diff = min(self.diff, abs(root.val-self.pre))
            self.pre = root.val
            inorder(root.right)
        
        inorder(root)
        return self.diff
```
