title: 389. Find the Difference
date:2018-03-01 18:27:39

#Description
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.
**Example:**
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
Output:
e
```
**Explanation:**
'e' is the letter that was added.

##1. XOR
```python
def findTheDifference(self, s, t):  
    sumt = 0
    sums = 0
    for char in t:
        sumt += ord(char)
    for char in s:
        sums += ord(char)
    return chr(sumt-sums)
```

##2. Collections
```python
def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
    return list((collections.Counter(t) - collections.Counter(s)))[0]
```
##3.
```python
def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
    s, t = sorted(s), sorted(t)
    return t[-1] if s == t[:-1] else [x[1] for x in zip(s, t) if x[0] != x[1]][0]
```

##4. next() + filter()
```python
def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
    return next(filter(None, map(lambda c, d: c != d and c, sorted(t), sorted(s))),max(t))
```

##5. next() + zip()
```python
def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
    return next(c for c, d in zip(sorted(t), sorted(s) + [None]) if c != d)
```
