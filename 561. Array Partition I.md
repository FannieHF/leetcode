```python
def arrayPairSum(self, nums):Ï
    nums.sort()
    nums.reverse()
    sum = 0
    while nums != []:
        sum += nums.pop()
        nums.pop()
    return sum
```

```python
def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
    return sum(sorted(nums)[::2])
```

#**Python's slice notation**
```
>>> seq[:]                # [seq[0],   seq[1],          ..., seq[-1]    ]
>>> seq[low:]             # [seq[low], seq[low+1],      ..., seq[-1]    ]
>>> seq[:high]            # [seq[0],   seq[1],          ..., seq[high-1]]
>>> seq[low:high]         # [seq[low], seq[low+1],      ..., seq[high-1]]
>>> seq[::stride]         # [seq[0],   seq[stride],     ..., seq[-1]    ]
>>> seq[low::stride]      # [seq[low], seq[low+stride], ..., seq[-1]    ]
>>> seq[:high:stride]     # [seq[0],   seq[stride],     ..., seq[high-1]]
>>> seq[low:high:stride] 
```
Of course, if (high-low)%stride != 0, then the end point will be a little lower than high-1.
If stride is negative, the ordering is changed a bit since we're counting down:
```
>>> seq[::-stride]        # [seq[-1],   seq[-1-stride],   ..., seq[0]    ]
>>> seq[high::-stride]    # [seq[high], seq[high-stride], ..., seq[0]    ]
>>> seq[:low:-stride]     # [seq[-1],   seq[-1-stride],   ..., seq[low+1]]
>>> seq[high:low:-stride] # [seq[high], seq[high-stride], ..., seq[low+1]]
```
