title: 383. Ransom Note
date:2018-03-04 23:14:25

# Description
Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.
Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.
**Note:**
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
```
canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true
```

# Answer
##1. count()
```python
def canConstruct(self, ransomNote, magazine):
    for letter in set(ransomNote):
        if ransomNote.count(letter) > magazine.count(letter) :
            return False
    return True
```

##2. O(m+n) + collections.Counter()
```python
def canConstruct(self, ransomNote, magazine):
    return not collections.Counter(ransomNote) - collections.Counter(magazine)
```
It returns True if and only if the dictionary is empty. However, the subtraction operator keeps only positive values, so not here essentially means “return False if there are any positive values”. But since we’re subtracting magazine from ransomNote, any positive value would be negative if we were subtracting ransomNote from magazine (which makes much more sense intuitively). Any negative count in such subtraction means we spent more letters than available, so we return False.

**Explanations:**
```python
import collections
r = collections.Counter({'a':2,'b':3})
m = collections.Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 0, 'c': 3, 'd': 6})
r.subtract(m)
r # Counter({'a': -1, 'b': 3, 'c': -3, 'd': -6})

r = collections.Counter({'a':2,'b':3})
m = collections.Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 0, 'c': 3, 'd': 6})
print(r - m)
# Counter({'b': 3})
```

Because of all that confusion, even though this solution is incredibly concise, I’d rather solve it in a more direct way:

```python3
c = Counter(magazine)
c.subtract(Counter(ransomNote))
return all(v >= 0 for v in c.values())
```
