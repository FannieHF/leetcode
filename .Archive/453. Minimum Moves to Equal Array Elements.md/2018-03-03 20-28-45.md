title: 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements
date:2018-03-03 17:33:35
# Description

Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.
**Example:**
```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```

# Answer
```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        diff = sum([num - nums[0] for num in nums])
        return diff
```
