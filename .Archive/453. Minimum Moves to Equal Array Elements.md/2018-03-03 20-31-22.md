title: 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements
date:2018-03-03 17:33:35
# Description

Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.
**Example:**
```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```

# Answer
```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums):
        mini = min(nums)
        return sum([num - mini for num in nums])
```

# Arithmetic
let’s define sum as the sum of all the numbers, before any moves; minNum as the min number int the list; n is the length of the list;

After, say m moves, we get all the numbers as x , and we will get the following equation
```
 sum + m * (n - 1) = x * n
```
and actually,
```
x = minNum + m
```
Let me explain why x = minNum + m
our goal is :increment minNum to be equal to maxNum
No matter how many add operations are executed,the goal won’t change.
Every time we do the add operation,the min number in the array must participate in.
After an add operation,the minNum is still the min number
So the minNum participate in every add operation
So x = minNum + m
and finally, we will get
```
sum - minNum * n = m
```
So, it is clear and easy now.
