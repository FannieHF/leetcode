## check from right to left
```python
def hasAlternatingBits(self, n):
    last = bin(n)[-1]
    for i in bin(n)[-2:1:-1]:
        if int(last)^int(i) != 1:
            return False
        last = i
    return True
```

##1. Cancel Bits
Xor the number with itself shifted right twice and check whether everything after the leading 1-bit became/stayed 0. Xor is 0 iff the bits are equal, so we get 0-bits iff the pair of leading 1-bit and the 0-bit in front of it are repeated until the end.

```ruby
bool hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
    return !((n ^= n/4) & n-1);
}
```

```python
def hasAlternatingBits(self,n) {
    n ^=
}
```
