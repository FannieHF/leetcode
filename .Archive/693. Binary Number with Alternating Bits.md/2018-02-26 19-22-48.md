## check from right to left
```python
def hasAlternatingBits(self, n):
    last = bin(n)[-1]
    for i in bin(n)[-2:1:-1]:
        if int(last)^int(i) != 1:
            return False
        last = i
    return True
```

##1. Cancel Bits
Xor the number with itself shifted right twice and check whether everything after the leading 1-bit became/stayed 0. Xor is 0 iff the bits are equal, so we get 0-bits iff the pair of leading 1-bit and the 0-bit in front of it are repeated until the end.

```ruby
bool hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
    return !((n ^= n/4) & n-1);
}

#      000101010
#   ^ 000001010
#   = 000100000
```
```python
def hasAlternatingBits(self, n):
        n ^= n>>2
        return not  n&n-1
```

##2. Complete Bits
Xor the number with itself shifted right once and check whether everything after the leading 1-bit became/stayed 1. Xor is 1 iff the bits differ, so we get 1-bits iff starting with the leading 1-bit, the bits alternate between 1 and 0.
```ruby
bool hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
    return !((n ^= n/2) & n+1);
}

#      000101010
#   ^ 000010101
#   = 000111111
```
```python
def hasAlternatingBits(self, n):
        n ^= n>>1
        return not  n&n+1
```
