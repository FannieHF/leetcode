**x << y**
Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by 2**y.
**x >> y**
Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. This is the same as //'ing x by 2**y.
**x & y**
Does a "bitwise and". Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it's 0.
**x | y**
Does a "bitwise or". Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 0, otherwise it's 1.
**~ x**
Returns the complement of x - the number you get by switching each 1 for a 0 and each 0 for a 1. This is the same as **-x - 1**.
**x ^ y**
Does a "bitwise EXCLUSIVE OR". Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in x if that bit in y is 0, and it's the complement of the bit in x if that bit in y is 1.

```python
bin(255)
# 0b11111111

x = 1 #01
y = 3 #11
print(x^y) #2
print(x&y) #1
print(x|y)  #3

x = 1 #01
y = 2 #10
print (x) #1
print (~x) #-2
print ("bin(-x)",bin(-x)) #-0b1
print (x&y) #0
print ("(bin(x&y))",bin(x&y)) #0b0
print (~(x&y)) #-1
print ("bin(~(x&y))",bin(~(x&y))) #-0b1
print (~x&y) #2
print ("bin(~x&y)",bin(~x&y)) #0b10

x = 1 #01
y = 3 #11
print (y) #3
print (~y) #-4
print ("bin(-y)",bin(-y)) #-0b11
print (x&y) #1
print ("(bin(x&y))",bin(x&y)) #0b1
print (~(x&y)) #-2
print ("bin(~(x&y))",bin(~(x&y))) #-0b10
print (~x&y) #2
print ("bin(y)",bin(y)) #0b11
print ("bin(-x)",bin(-x)) #-0b1
print ("bin(~x&y)",bin(~x&y)) #0b10

x = 25
print(bin(x)) #0b11001
print(bin(x << 5)) #0b1100100000
print(bin(x >> 1)) #0b1100

ONE. number
```python
 def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
    diff = 0
    while not (x <= 1 and y <= 1):
        if ((x % 2) != (y % 2)):
            diff += 1
        x = x // 2
        y = y // 2
    if (x != y):
        diff += 1  

    return diff
```

TWO. built-in python function
```python
def hammingDistance(self, x, y);
    return bin(x^y).count("1")
```
