```python
bin(255)
# 0b11111111

x = 1 #01
y = 3 #11
print(x^y) #2
print(x&y) #1
print(x|y)  #3

x = 1 #01
y = 2 #10
print (x)
print (~x) #-2
print ("bin(-x)",bin(-x))
print (x&y) #0
print ("(bin(x&y))",bin(x&y))
print (~(x&y)) #-1
print ("bin(~(x&y))",bin(~(x&y)))
print (~x&y) #2
print ("bin(~x&y)",bin(~x&y))
```

ONE. number
```python
 def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
    diff = 0
    while not (x <= 1 and y <= 1):
        if ((x % 2) != (y % 2)):
            diff += 1
        x = x // 2
        y = y // 2
    if (x != y):
        diff += 1  

    return diff
```

TWO. built-in python function
```python
def hammingDistance(self, x, y);
    return bin(x^y).count("1")
```
