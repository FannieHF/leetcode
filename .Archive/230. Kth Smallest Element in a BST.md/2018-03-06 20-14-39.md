# Description
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
**Note: **
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
**Follow up:**
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
