title: 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
date:2018-03-06 19:46:17

# Description
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
**Note: **
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
**Follow up:**
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

# Answer
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root, k):
        self. k = k
        self.output = 0
        
        def inorder(root):
            if not root:
                return
            inorder(root.left)
            self.k -= 1
            if not self.k:
                self.output = root.val
                return
            inorder(root.right)
        
        inorder(root)
        return self.output
```
