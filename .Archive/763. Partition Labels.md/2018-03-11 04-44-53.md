title: 763. Partition Labels
date:2018-03-11 04:03:43

# Description
A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
**Note:**
1. S will have length in range [1, 500].
2. S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

# Answer
```python3
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        import collections
        output = []
        pre = -1
        for i in range(len(S)):
            front = S[:i+1]
            back = S[i+1:]
            if not set(front)&set(back):
                output.append(i-pre)
                pre = i
        return output
```

## Faster
```python
## change S so cut the subtraction of index
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        sizes = []
        while S:
            i = 1
            while set(S[:i]) & set(S[i:]):
                i += 1
            sizes.append(i)
            S = S[i:]
        return sizes
```
