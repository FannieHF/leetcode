##1. brute - count() + **&**
```python
def judgeCircle(self, moves):
    """
    :type moves: str
    :rtype: bool
    """
    return ((moves.count("R") == moves.count("L")) & (moves.count("U")==moves.count("D")))
```

## 2. brute - count() + **and**
```python
def judgeCircle(self, moves):
    return moves.count("R") == moves.count("L") and moves.count("U")==moves.count("D")
```

**In python, count is much faster than Counter**
##3. collections.Counter
```python
def judgeCircle(self, moves):
    c = collections.Counter(moves)
    return c['L'] == c['R'] and c['U'] == c['D']
```
