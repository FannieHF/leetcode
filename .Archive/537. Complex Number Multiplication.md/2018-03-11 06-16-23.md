title: 537. Complex Number Multiplication
date:2018-03-11 06:07:28

Given two strings representing two complex numbers.

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
Output: "0+2i"
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
Output: "0+-2i"
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.
```
**Note:**
The input strings will not have extra blank.
The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.


# Answer
```python
class Solution(object):
    def complexNumberMultiply(self, a, b):
        a = map(int,a[:-1].split("+"))
        b = map(int,b[:-1].split("+"))
        return '%d+%di'%(a[0]*b[0]-a[1]*b[1],a[1]*b[0]+b[1]*a[0])

```
