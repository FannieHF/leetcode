title: 563. Binary Tree Tilt
date:2018-03-06 22:31:01

# Description
Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the **whole tree**.

The tilt of a **tree node** is defined as the **absolute difference** between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

The tilt of the **whole tree** is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
         1
       /   \
      2     3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```
**Note:**
1. The sum of node values in any subtree won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.
2. All the tilt values won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.

# Answer
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def findTilt(self, root):
        
        self.absSum = 0
        
        def calSum(root):
            if root == None:
                return 0
            leftSum = calSum(root.left)
            rightSum = calSum(root.right)
            self.absSum += abs(rightSum-leftSum)
            return root.val + leftSum + rightSum
        
        calSum(root)
        return self.absSum
```
