###7.2.5.3. search() vs. match()
Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).

### findall()
findall() matches all occurrences of a pattern, not just the first one as search() does. For example, if one was a writer and wanted to find all of the adverbs in some text, he or she might use findall() in the following manner:
```python
text = "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police."
re.findall(r"\w+ly", text)
# ['carefully', 'quickly']
```
