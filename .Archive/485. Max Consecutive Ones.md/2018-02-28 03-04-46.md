###7.2.5.3. search() vs. match()
Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).

### findall()
findall() matches all occurrences of a pattern, not just the first one as search() does. For example, if one was a writer and wanted to find all of the adverbs in some text, he or she might use findall() in the following manner:
```python
text = "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police."
re.findall(r"\w+ly", text)
#['carefully', 'quickly']
```

# Desctription
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
```
Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```
Note:
- The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
- The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

##1. Simple
```python
def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums):
    output = [0]
    for num in nums:
        if num:
            output[-1] += 1
        else:
            output.append(0)
    return max(output)
```
