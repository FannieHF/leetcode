title: 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
date:2018-03-05 20:13:00

# Description
Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
**Example:**
```
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1
```
**Explanation:**
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.


# Answer
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root):
        
        seq = []
        def preorder(root):
            if not root:
                return 
            preorder(root.left)
            seq.append(root.val)
            preorder(root.right)
        
        preorder(root)
        
        min_diff = seq[-1]
        seq = zip(seq,seq[1:])
        for a,b in seq:
            min_diff = min(b-a,min_diff)
        return min_diff

```
