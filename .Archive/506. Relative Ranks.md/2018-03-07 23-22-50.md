title: 506. Relative Ranks
date:2018-03-07 22:43:14

Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". 
For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
```
**Note:**
N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.

# Answer
```python3
class Solution:
    def findRelativeRanks(self, nums):
        sequence = sorted(nums, reverse = True)
        dic = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i == 0:
                dic[sequence[i]] = "Gold Medal"
            elif i == 1:
                dic[sequence[i]] = "Silver Medal"
            elif i == 2:
                dic[sequence[i]] = "Bronze Medal"
            else:
                dic[sequence[i]] = str(i+1)
        
        return list(map(lambda x: dic[x], nums))
```

## way slower
```python3
class Solution:
    def findRelativeRanks(self, nums):
        sequence = sorted(nums, reverse = True)
        output = []
        for num in nums:
            case = sequence.index(num)
            if case == 0:
                output.append("Gold Medal")
            elif case == 1:
                output.append("Silver Medal")
            elif case == 2:
                output.append("Bronze Medal")
            else:
                output.append(str(case+1))
        
        return output
```
