ONE. or
```sql
SELECT name,population,area from World
WHERE population > 25000000 OR area > 3000000;
```

TWO. union
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name,population,area from World
WHERE population > 25000000 
UNION
SELECT name,population,area from World
WHERE area > 3000000;
```

## Why Union is faster than OR?
- Strictly speaking, Using <b>UNION</b> is faster when it comes to cases like scan two different column like this.
- (Of course using UNION ALL is much faster than UNION since we donâ€™t need to sort the result. But it violates the requirements)
- Suppose we are searching population and area, Given that MySQL usually uses one one index per table in a given query, so when it uses the 1st index rather than 2nd index, it would still have to do a table-scan to find rows that fit the 2nd index.
- When using UNION, each sub-query can use the index of its search, then combine the sub-query by UNION.
- I quote from a benchmark about UNION and OR, feel free to check it out:
