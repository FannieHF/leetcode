# Description
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.
For example,
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
**Note:**
- Given n will always be valid.
- Try to do this in one pass.

#Answer
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    self. n = n
    def back(head):
        if head == None:
            return None
        head.next = back(head.next)
        self.n -= 1
        if self.n == 0:
            return head.next
        return head
    
    return back(head)
```
