title: 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
date:2018-03-06 18:50:59

# Description
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.
For example,
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
**Note:**
- Given n will always be valid.
- Try to do this in one pass.

#Answer
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    self. n = n
    def back(head):
        if head == None:
            return None
        head.next = back(head.next)
        self.n -= 1
        if self.n == 0:
            return head.next
        return head
    
    return back(head)
```
## Index and Remove
In this solution I recursively determine the indexes again, but this time my helper function removes the nth node. It returns two values. The index, as in my first solution, and the possibly changed head of the remaining list.
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    def remove(head):
        if not head:
            return 0, head
        i, head.next = remove(head.next)
        return i+1, (head, head.next)[i+1 == n] # if i+1 == n (True), then return head.next
        # print((1,2)[1==1]) //2
        # print((1,2)[1==2]) //1
    return remove(head)[1]
```

## Value-shifting
Instead of really removing the nth node, I remove the nth value. I recursively determine the indexes (counting from back), then shift the values for all indexes larger than n, and then always drop the head.
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    def index(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        i = index(node.next) + 1
        if i > n:
            node.next.val = node.val
        return i
    index(head)
    return head.next
```

## fast and slow pointer
A one pass solution can be done using pointers. Move one pointer fast --> n+1 places forward, to maintain a gap of n between the two pointers and then move both at the same speed. Finally, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be n+1 places behind - just the right spot for it to be able to skip the next node.

Since the question gives that n is valid, not too many checks have to be put in place. Otherwise, this would be necessary.
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    delta = 1
    fast_pointer = head
    for _ in range(delta,n):
        fast_pointer = fast_pointer.next
        delta += 1
        
    slow_pointer = ListNode(0)
    slow_pointer.next = head
    while(fast_pointer.next!=None):
        slow_pointer = slow_pointer.next
        fast_pointer = fast_pointer.next
    
    if slow_pointer.next == head:
        return head.next
    slow_pointer.next = slow_pointer.next.next
    return head
```
