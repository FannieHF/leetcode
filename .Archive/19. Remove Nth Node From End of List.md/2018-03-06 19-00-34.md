title: 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
date:2018-03-06 18:50:59

# Description
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.
For example,
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
**Note:**
- Given n will always be valid.
- Try to do this in one pass.

#Answer
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    self. n = n
    def back(head):
        if head == None:
            return None
        head.next = back(head.next)
        self.n -= 1
        if self.n == 0:
            return head.next
        return head
    
    return back(head)
```

## Improve by Discuess
In this solution I recursively determine the indexes again, but this time my helper function removes the nth node. It returns two values. The index, as in my first solution, and the possibly changed head of the remaining list.
```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        def remove(head):
            if not head:
                return 0, head
            i, head.next = remove(head.next)
            return i+1, (head, head.next)[i+1 == n]
        return remove(head)[1]
```
