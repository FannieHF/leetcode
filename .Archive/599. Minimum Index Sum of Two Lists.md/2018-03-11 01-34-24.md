title: 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists
date:2018-03-11 00:09:27

# Description
Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their **common interest** with the **least list index** sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```
**Note:**
1. The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
2. The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
3. The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
4. No duplicates in both lists.

# Answer
```python
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):
        fav = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for index,name in enumerate(list1):
            fav[name].append(index)
        for index,name in enumerate(list2):
            fav[name].append(index)
        mini = float("inf")
        output = []
        for key,value in fav.items():
            if len(value) != 1 and sum(value)<mini:
                mini = sum(value)
                output = [key]
            elif len(value) != 1 and sum(value) == mini:
                output.append(key)
            
        return output
```

## Faster
```python3
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):
        fav = {}
        for index,name in enumerate(list1):
            fav[name] = index
        mini = float("inf")
        output = []
        for index,name in enumerate(list2):
            if name in fav:
            # when change last line to "if name in list1:" => three times slower
                fav[name] += index
                if fav[name] < mini:
                    mini = fav[name]
                    output = [name]
                elif fav[name] == mini:
                    output.append(name)
            
        return output
```
