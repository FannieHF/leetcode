title: 371. Sum of Two Integers
date:2018-03-01 20:56:19

#Description
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.
**Example:**
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3.

##1. Works for Java but not Python when it comes to negative integers
```java
public int getSum(int a, int b) {
	if (a == 0) return b;
	if (b == 0) return a;
	while (b != 0) {
		int carry = a & b;
		a = a ^ b;
		b = carry << 1;
	}
	return a;
}
```
```python
def getSum(self, a, b):
    if (a == 0):
        return b
    if (b == 0):
        return a

    while (b != 0):
        carry = a & b
        a = a ^ b
        b = carry << 1
    return a;
    
# input: -1, 2
#  Time Limit Exceeded
```

##2.  same with NO. 1 but covert from 64 bits to 32 bits
```python
def getSum(self, a, b):
    # 32 bits integer max
    MAX = 0x7FFFFFFF
    # mask to get last 32 bits
    mask = 0xFFFFFFFF
    while b != 0:
        # ^ get different bits and & gets double 1s, << moves carry
        a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask
    # if a is negative, get a's 32 bits complement positive first
    # then get 32-bit positive's Python complement negative
    return a if a <= MAX else ~(a ^ mask)
```
**Explanation:**
Python has more than 32 bits for integers. You can try to run "print 2 \* \* 31"and Python would shows the exact number correctly, while other languages like Java would not. Java only recognizes -2 \* \*  31 to 2 \** 31 - 1.
How does integers presented in Python differ from integers in 32-bit e.g. Java?
From what I heard, Python has 64 bits. (Please let me know if I am wrong. )
So 1 in Python would look like 0x0000000000000001, but it looks like 0x00000001 in 32-bit format. -1 in Python would look like 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, but it looks like 0xFFFFFFFF in 32-bit format.
It seems that the input given by LC is in 32-bit format. Since Python would treat it as positive with 1 on the 32 position, we have to use mask to treat it as negative.
